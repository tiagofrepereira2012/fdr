    "\n",
    "The hyper-parameter $\\alpha$ in equation 7 has a crucial role in the computation of $\\text{FDR}(\\tau)$.\n",
    "Such value is a business/application decision. For instance, a bank that deploys a biometric verification system in an ATM might prefer to favor fairness towards False Non-Matches and, for this reason, $\\alpha$ can assume low values.\n",
    "On the other hand, in a border control scenario, where false matches are more critical, decision-makers might decide to favor fairness towards False-Matches.\n",
    "Hence, $\\alpha$ should be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how alpha plays the FMR and FNMR trade-offs by observing the FDR values for the synthetiv unfair and fair biometric verification systems.\n",
    "FDR is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$FDR(\\tau) = 1- (\\alpha A(\\tau) + (1-\\alpha) B(\\tau))$$\n"
